# Titanic Survival Analysis with Decision Tree

## Overview
This project utilizes a decision tree model to analyze survival rates among passengers of the Titanic, based on the dataset from Kaggle. The analysis aims to understand how factors such as socio-economic status, age, and gender influenced survival chances.

## Data Preparation
- **Dataset Source**: Kaggle (Titanic dataset)
- **Cleaning Process**: Removed irrelevant columns, encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked), and categorized age and fare into brackets.
- **Index**: Used PassengerId as the dataset index.

## Model
- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree
- **Objective**: To predict survival based on input features like Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, and Embarked.

## Results
- The model provides insights into the significant factors affecting survival on the Titanic. Detailed analysis and interpretation of the model's findings are included.
